There are some really amazing and beautiful animated wind maps around such as https://github.com/Esri/wind-js and https://www.windy.com/ but nothing I found could a) use live Met Office observations and forecasts and b) use native Map Box functionality over Web GL and complex things. So this is a rough go at it. My front end skills are a bit shoddy but feel free to edit this to make it prettier or more accurate.
Cedit for the animated linestring in Map Box goes to this Stack Overlflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52942290/draw-a-linear-animated-line-between-two-markers-in-mapbox
